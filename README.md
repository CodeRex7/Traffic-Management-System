# Traffic-Management-System
Self City Traffic inversion System in a build Simulator which is based on live processed videos of cars Entering into the city using a camera under a Bridge.

The Image Processing of the live videos is done by using Frame Difference and ia accurately calculating the number of cars entering into the City.

The simulator has these properties:
1. The Simulator App is updated with entering coordinates and destiantion of eaceh and every car driver entering the city with a car.
2. The Simulator App provides each car to travel to the destination in shortest path.
3. The Simulator App provides each car to travel to the destination in shortest time.
4. The Simulator App is built in such a way that the traffic lights are dynamic and are reactive to the weightage of cars in each lane and road.
5. The Simulator App provides Collision Prevention Technology and even provides data to the car driver when to switch lanes depending on the traffic lying ahead in each lane.
